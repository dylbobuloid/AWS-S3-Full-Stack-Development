# Full Stack Web App (Spring Boot + React + AWS)

This project is based on the [[Spring Boot, React.js & AWS S3 Full Stack Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1gQ7w2V24)]
I followed the course to build and understand a production-ready web application, integrating Spring Boot, React, and AWS services.

## Features
- Spring Boot REST API for user management
- React frontend with Axios for API communication
- AWS S3 integration for image/file upload
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Deployed on AWS (EC2/S3)

## My Contributions
- Implemented, debugged, and deployed all features independently
- Added custom UI improvements and configurations
- Gained hands-on experience with full-stack integration and AWS deployment
